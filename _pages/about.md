I am a PhD student at Yale working primarily with Dr. Molly Crockett. I received my BA in Psychology from Simon Fraser University in Canada, and then worked as a full-time RA in Jamil Zaki's lab at Stanford University. 

My research utilizes behavioral experiments and neuroimaging to study social perception and social decision-making.
