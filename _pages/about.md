`I'm a third year PhD student in the Department of Psychology at Yale University, primarily advised by Molly Crockett. I completed my BA in Psychology at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, BC â€” and then worked as a full-time RA in Jamil Zaki's social neuroscience lab at Stanford University.` 

`I'm interested in what motivates us to help others and act morally, as well as how moral concerns shape our inferences and our memories. I study these topics using theory and methods in social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience.`
