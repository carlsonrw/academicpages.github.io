<sub>I'm a PhD candidate in psychology at Yale University working with [Molly Crockett](http://www.crockettlab.org/). Before Yale, I completed my BA at Simon Fraser University, just outside of Vancouver, BC, and worked as a post-bac RA for two years with [Jamil Zaki](http://ssnl.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University.

<sub>My research explores topics in social cognition (e.g., how we make inferences about other peoples' motives) and motivated cognition (e.g., how moral concerns bias our inferences and memories). To learn more about my past and present work, check out my [publications](https://carlsonrw.github.io/publications/) page.
