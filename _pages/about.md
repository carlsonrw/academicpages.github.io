I'm a fourth year PhD student in psychology at Yale University working with [Molly Crockett](http://www.crockettlab.org/). Before Yale, I completed my BA at Simon Fraser University, just outside of Vancouver, BC, and worked as a post-bac RA for two years with [Jamil Zaki](http://ssnl.stanford.edu/) in the Department of Psychology at Stanford University.

I'm interested in social cognition (e.g, how we make inferences about others' motives), and motivated cognition (e.g., how moral concerns shape our inferences and our memories). I study these topics using theory and methods from social psychology, computer science, and cognitive neuroscience.
