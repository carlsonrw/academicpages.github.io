`I'm a PhD student in the Department of Psychology at Yale University, primarily advised by Molly Crockett. I completed my BA in Psychology from Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, BC â€” and subsequently worked as a full-time RA in Jamil Zaki's lab at Stanford University. Broadly speaking, I study what motivates us to help others and act morally, as well as peoples' intuitive theories of their own motives. I study these topics using theory and methods in social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience.`
