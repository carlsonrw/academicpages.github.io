I am a PhD student in the Department of Psychology at Yale University, advised by [Molly Crockett](http://www.crockettlab.org/). I study what motivates people to help others (prosocial motivation) using theory and methods from social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience.

You can learn more about my research [here](https://carlsonrw.github.io/publications/).
