`I'm a third year PhD student in psychology at Yale University working primarily with Molly Crockett. My research explores what motivates people to be kind to others, as well as how moral concerns shape peoples' inferences and memories. I study these topics using theory and methods in social psychology, computer science, and cognitive neuroscience.`
