<sub>I'm a PhD candidate in psychology at Yale University working with [Molly Crockett](http://www.crockettlab.org/). Before Yale, I completed my BA at Simon Fraser University, just outside of Vancouver, BC, and worked as a post-bac RA for two years with [Jamil Zaki](http://ssnl.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University.

<sub>I study social cognition (e.g., how we make inferences about other peoples' motives) and motivated cognition (e.g., how moral concerns bias our inferences and memories). My work draws on theory and methods from social psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience. To learn more about my research, check out my [publications](https://carlsonrw.github.io/publications/) page.
