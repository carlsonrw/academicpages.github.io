I'm a PhD student in the Department of Psychology at Yale University. In my research, I use neuroimaging, computational modelling, and behavioral experiments to uncover how we **perceive** other minds and how we **interact** with them.

You can learn more about my research [here](https://carlsonrw.github.io/publications/).
