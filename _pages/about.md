`I'm a PhD student in the Department of Psychology at Yale University, primarily advised by Molly Crockett. Previously, I completed a BA in Psychology at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, BC â€” and then worked for two years as a full-time RA in Jamil Zaki's lab at Stanford University.` 

`I'm interested in what motivates us to help others and act morally, and how these motives shape our minds and our actions. I study these topics using theory and methods in social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience.`
