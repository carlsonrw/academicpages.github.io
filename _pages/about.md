I'm a fourth year PhD student in psychology at Yale University working with [Molly Crockett](http://www.crockettlab.org/). Before Yale, I completed my BA at Simon Fraser University, just outside of Vancouver, BC, and worked as a post-bac RA for two years with [Jamil Zaki](http://ssnl.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University.

Broadly, my research explores topics in social cognition (e.g., how we make inferences about other peoples' motives) and motivated cognition (e.g., how moral concerns shape our own inferences and memories). I study such topics using theory and methods from social psychology and cognitive science.
