`I'm a graduate student in the Department of Psychology at Yale University, advised by Molly Crockett. I'm interested in what motivates people to engage in actions that benefit others (prosocial motivation), as well as peoples' na√Øve theories about what motivates such acts. I study these topics using theory and methods from social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience.`
