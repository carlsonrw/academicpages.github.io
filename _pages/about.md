I'm a fourth year PhD student in psychology at Yale University working primarily with [Molly Crockett](http://www.crockettlab.org/). I received my BA from Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada, and worked a post-bac RA in the Department of Psychology at Stanford University with [Jamil Zaki](http://ssnl.stanford.edu/). 

My research explores what motivates people to be kind to others, as well as how moral concerns shape peoples' inferences and memories. I study these topics using theory and methods in social psychology, computer science, and cognitive neuroscience.
