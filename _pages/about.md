`I'm a PhD student in the Psychology Department at Yale University, primarily advised by Molly Crockett. I'm interested in what motivates people to pursue social and personal goals, as well as peoples' na√Øve theories of motivation. I study these topics using theory and methods from social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience.`
