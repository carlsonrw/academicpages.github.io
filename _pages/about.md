`I'm a PhD student in Psychology at Yale University, primarily advised by Molly Crockett. I'm interested in what motivates people to engage in social behavior, as well as peoples' na√Øve theories of social motivation. I study these topics using theory and methods from social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience.`
