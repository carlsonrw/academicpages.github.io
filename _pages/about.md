`I'm a third year PhD student in Psychology at Yale University working with Molly Crockett. Before grad school, I completed a BA in psychology at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, BC (close to where I grew up). After my BA, I spent two years working as a full-time RA in Jamil Zaki's social neuroscience lab at Stanford University.` 

`I'm interested in what motivates people to be kind and moral, as well as how moral concerns shape peoples' inferences and memories. I study these topics using theory and methods in social psychology, computer science, and cognitive neuroscience.`
