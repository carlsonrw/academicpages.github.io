`I'm a PhD student in the Department of Psychology at Yale University, primarily advised by Molly Crockett. Before grad school, I completed my BA in Psychology at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, BC â€” and then worked as a full-time RA in Jamil Zaki's lab at Stanford University.` 

`I study what motivates humans to help others and act morally, and how these motives shape our cognitions and actions. I study such topics using theory and methods in social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience.`
