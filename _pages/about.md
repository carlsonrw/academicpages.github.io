I am a PhD student in the Department of Psychology at Yale University, where I primarily work with Molly Crockett. I received my BA in Psychology from Simon Fraser University in Canada, and subsequently worked as a research assistant with Jamil Zaki at Stanford University. 

My research utilizes behavioral experiments, neuroimaging, and computational modelling to study how we **perceive** other minds and how we **interact** with them.
