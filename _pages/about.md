`I'm a 4th year PhD student in psychology at Yale University working primarily with Molly Crockett. Before grad school, I completed a BA in Psychology at Simon Fraser University in Canada, and then worked as a full-time RA in Jamil Zaki's lab at Stanford University. My research explores what motivates people to be kind to others, as well as how moral concerns shape peoples' inferences and memories. I study these topics using theory and methods in social psychology, computer science, and cognitive neuroscience.`
