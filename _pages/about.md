I'm a fourth year PhD student in psychology at Yale University, where I work primarily with [Molly Crockett](http://www.crockettlab.org/). Before grad school, I completed my BA at Simon Fraser University, just outside of Vancouver, BC, and then worked as a post-bac RA for two years at Stanford University with [Jamil Zaki](http://ssnl.stanford.edu/). 

My research explores what motivates people to be kind to others, as well as how moral concerns shape peoples' inferences and memories. I study these topics using theory and methods in social psychology, computer science, and cognitive neuroscience.
