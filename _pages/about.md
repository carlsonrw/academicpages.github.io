`I'm a third year PhD student in psychology at Yale University working primarily with Molly Crockett. I completed my BA in psychology at Simon Fraser University (outside of Vancouver, BC), and then worked as a full-time RA in Jamil Zaki's social neuroscience lab at Stanford University.` 

`My research explores what motivates people to be kind to others, as well as how moral concerns shape peoples' inferences and memories. I study these topics using theory and methods in social psychology, computer science, and cognitive neuroscience.`
