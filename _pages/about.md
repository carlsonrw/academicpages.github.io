I'm a fourth year PhD student in psychology at Yale University working with [Molly Crockett](http://www.crockettlab.org/). I completed my BA at Simon Fraser University, just outside of Vancouver, BC, and I worked as a post-bac RA for two years with [Jamil Zaki](http://ssnl.stanford.edu/) in the Department of Psychology at Stanford University.

I'm interested in prosocial behavior (why we help others), social cognition (why we think we help others), and motivated cognition (how moral concerns shape our inferences and our memories). I study these topics using theory and methods in social psychology, computer science, and cognitive neuroscience.
