I'm a PhD student in the Department of Psychology at Yale University. I study how we **perceive** other minds and how we **interact** with them in prosocial situations. 

Social life is replete with acts of kindness, and a range of motives can underlie these acts. How do perceivers discern whether a kind act was driven by concern for others' well-being (e.g., empathy), or by personal gain (e.g., praise or reciprocity)? A perceiverâ€™s ability to parse such motives is useful for knowing who to trust and befriend (i.e., who is genuinely kind, and willing to support us in the long run?), but also for encouraging kindness in social life more broadly (i.e., who is most deserving of praise?). In my research, I use theory and methods from psychology, computer science, and neuroscience to study how we make social inferences in this domain.
