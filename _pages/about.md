I am a PhD student in Psychology at Yale University, where I work primarily with Molly Crockett. I received my BA in Psychology from Simon Fraser University in Canada, and then spent two years as a research assistant in Jamil Zaki's lab at Stanford University. 

My research utilizes behavioral experiments, neuroimaging, and computational modelling to study how we **perceive** other minds and how we **interact** with them.
