I'm a PhD student in the Department of Psychology at Yale University, advised by [Molly Crockett](http://www.crockettlab.org/). I'm interested in what motivates people to help others, and how people interpret others' motives for helping. My research uses theory and methods from social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience.
