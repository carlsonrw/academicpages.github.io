`I'm a graduate student in the Department of Psychology at Yale University, primarily advised by Molly Crockett. I'm interested in what motivates people to help others (prosocial motivation), as well as peoples' na√Øve theories of prosociality. I study these topics using theory and methods from social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience.`
